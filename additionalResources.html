<p> Here is some stuff that will really help you out in the long run.</p>

<p>
    <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"> HackerRank</a>  is great for learning ins and outs of a language. Along with <a href = "https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=cpp">cpp</a>, i'd really reccomend learning <a href = "https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=python">python</a> as well.

<p>
    <a href="https://leetcode.com/"> LeetCode </a> is great for interview prep and is really good for learning data structres. If you are going to use the <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/">"explore"</a> section for data strctures (which I reccomend you should), 
    make sure you do these first:
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Arrays and strings </li>
    <li> Queues and Stacks </li>
    <li> Recursion and Binary Search </li>
    <li> Linked lists </li>
    <li> Binary Trees </li>
</ol>
