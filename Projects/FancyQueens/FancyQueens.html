<h1>Fancy Queens</h1>

<p> <a href="#">Template here</a></p>


<h3> Problem Statement: </h3>
<p>
    Your boss is very proud of you for compleating 8 Queens (you should be too!) and wants to show off your work to both your peers and the masses. <br>
    But 1's and 0's arn't very exciting to look at. Do you think you would be able to make it somehow... fancier?
</p>

<p>
    Continueing off our recursive 8 Queens solution (it's okay if you haven't done it, it won't effect your understanding)
    we modify the print statement to look fancy.
</p>

    <figcaption> fig 2: A regular board should look something like this. </figcaption>
</figure>

    <img src="solution.PNG" alt="">
    <figcaption> fig 3: and a completed board, like this. </figcaption>
</figure>


<p>
     Our solution is going to involve <a href="https://venus.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~jchen/CS211/Notes/Typedef/">"typedef"</a> to "create"
     a new datatype (in reality, we are just repackaging another datatype into something easier to work with). <br>
     This new datatype we are going to be working with is called "box" which is really just another name for a 5x7 char array. <br>
     Box will be the basis for how we build all of our unique spaces (fig 1 above).
</p>

<p> 
    Question: What is the intuitive datastructre for fancy print? 
</p>

<p> Answer: (highlight below to see answer) </p> 
<p style = "background:black; color:black">
    An 8x8 array of box.
</p>

<p> 
    But we can make this even more efficient. Since there is a lot of redundancy between boxes, instead of making the intuitive answer,
    lets instead make an 8x8 array of <em>pointers</em> to box.
</p>

<p> 
    The following steps are then as follows:<br>
    Each element in fancy print either points to the black space or the white space. <br>
    At this point, before even having a solution to 8 queens, we should be able to print out fig2. <br>
    Now, using both the unfancy solution, and the fancy print, we should be able to print the fancy array. <br>
    All we have to do is point to the respective queen instead of the the empty space. <br> <br>

    There is only one this we haven't covered yet... How do we actually print the board so neatly and on the same lines like in fig2???
    Hint: fancyBoard[i][j], is a pointer to a box. *(fancyBoard[i][j]) is the actual box itself.
