<h1> 8 Queens 2-D </h1>

<p> 
    Continuing our exploration of backtracking, we redo the 8 Queens Problem in a 2-D setting. <br/>
    This time around, we are going to be using <a href = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/goto-statement-in-c-cpp/" target = "_blank"> goto statements </a>.
</p>

<a target = "_blank" href = http://engineerwithoutfear.github.io/web_dev/visualizations-algorithms/8-queens-backtracking/index.html> Here is a visual to demonstrate the algorithm we will use.</a>
<p>
    Take note of how the algorithm moves through the board. Could you write down the steps it does exactly?
</p>

<p> How the algorithm should move: (highlight below to see the answer) </p>
<p class = "hideText">
    <ol class = "hide">
        <li> 1) Start queen at the top of the current column (if this is our first time we are starting in the first column).<br></li>
        <li> 2) check to see if the current space is ok </li>
            <ul>
                <li> 2.1) check diagonalUp</li>
                <li> 2.2) check Left</li>    
                <li> 2.3) check diagonalDown</li>
            </ul>
        <li> 3) If it is ok, move to next column and start from 1.</li>    
        <li> 4) If it is not ok, move to next row and start from 2.</li> 
        <li> 5) If during this process, we move beyond the last row, we backtrack </li>
        <li> 6) If during this process, we move beyond the last column, we have found 1 solution. </li>
    </ol>

    Note: Completing the assignment using gotos is manditory for credit. </br>
    But for those looking for additional practice, a template using a recursive solution is provided.
