<h3> Problem Statement: </h3>
<p>
    Suppose we have a standard chess board, and 8 queens. Find all possible placements of queens such that they do not
    attack each other.
    <br>
    Note:
    <ul>
        <li>The dimentions of a standard chessboard are 8 by 8.</li>
        <li>One queen can attack another if they are directly vertical, horizontal, or diagonal from one another.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3> Data Structure: </h3>
<p>
    Intuitively, representing a chessboard would done using a 2-d matrix. 
    However, lets trade intuition for simplicity.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src = "./queens1-DExample.png">
    <figcaption> The above 2-D representation transformed into a 1-D representation. The numbers represent the position (the row) of the queens,
        starting at zero.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    The algorithm is as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>Start with an array of size 8, all of the elements in the array are initialized to zero. </li>
        <li>Starting with the current queen (the first queen if this is our first iteration), 
            check to see if the queen is in a valid spot. Note: Checking will only occur to the left of the queen
            (assume everyting to the right of the queen has not been placed yet).
        </li>
        <ol>
            <li>If during the process of moving to the right we go beyond the board, print the board and backtrack.</li>
            <li>If during this process of moving the queen to next row, we go beyond the board, backtrack.</li>
            <li>If the queen is in a valid spot, move to the next column (to the right) and repeat 2</li>
            <li>If the queen is not in a valid spot, move the queen to the next row.</li>
        </ol>
        
    </ol>
</p>



<h3>Some extra stuff:</h3>
<p> 
    This problem can actually become more general, for example, instead of solving the 8 queens problem, what about 7 queens on a 7x7 board? 
    10 queens on a 10x10 board?
    <br>
    How about <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/"> n queens </a> on a nxn board?
