<h1> 8 Queens </h1>

<h3> Problem Statement: </h3>
<p> 
    Suppose we have a standard chess board, and 8 queens. Find all possible placements of queens such that they do not attack each other.
    <br>
    Note: 
    <ul>
        <li>The dimentions of a standard chessboard are 8 by 8.</li>
        <li>One queen can attack another if they are directly vertical, horizontal, or diagonal from one another.</li>
    </ul>
