<h1> 8 Queens </h1>

<h3> Problem Statement: </h3>
<p>
    Suppose we have a standard chess board, and 8 queens. Find all possible placements of queens such that they do not
    attack each other.
    <br>
    Note:
    <ul>
        <li>The dimentions of a standard chessboard are 8 by 8.</li>
        <li>One queen can attack another if they are directly vertical, horizontal, or diagonal from one another.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Some extra stuff:</h3>
<p> 
    This problem can actually become more general, for example, instead of solving the 8 queens problem, what about 7 queens on a 7x7 board? 
    10 queens on a 10x10 board?
    <br>
    How about <a href = "https://leetcode.com/problems/n-queens/"> n queens </a> on a nxn board?
