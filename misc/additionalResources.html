<h1> Additional Resources </h1>


<p> Here is some stuff that will really help you out in the long run.</p>

<p>
    <a target = "_blank" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"> HackerRank</a>  is great for learning ins and outs of a language.<br>
    If you are having trouble with the basics, start <a href = "https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=cpp" target = "_blank">here</a> for c++. <br> <br>


    If you find yourself with some extra time here is some more stuff for you to explore:
    <ul>
        <li> This is the best resource that you will ever find for computer science: <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a>.<br>
        If you are serious about becoming a better programmer, this is the only resource you will need to become very very good. </li> 
        <li> If your interested in making websites check out <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target = "_blank"> FreeCodeCamp </a></li>
        <li> If you find yourself with some extra time on your hands, <a href = "https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=python" target = "_blank">python</a> is a great language. </li> 
    </ul>


</p>


<p>
    <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target = "_blank"> LeetCode </a> is great for interview prep and is really good for learning data structres. If you are going to use the <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/" target = "_blank">"explore"</a> section for data strctures (which I recommend you should), 
    make sure you do these first:
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Arrays and strings </li>
    <li> Queues and Stacks </li>
    <li> Recursion and Binary Search </li>
    <li> Linked lists </li>
    <li> Binary Trees </li>
</ol>


<p> If you are interested in competitive programming, such as <a href = https://icpc.baylor.edu/ target = "_blank"> ICPC </a>, you should express 
your interest to either Professor Waxman or Edward Cerverizzo</p>
