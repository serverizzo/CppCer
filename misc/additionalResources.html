<h1> Additional Resources </h1>


<p> Here is some stuff that will really help you out in the long run.</p>

<p>

    <h2>Interview Prep</h2>
    <p> It's never too early to start looking for internships. Here are some great websites to help you out. </p>

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"> HackerRank </a> is a good place to start. <br>
    <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank"> LeetCode </a> is where you will want to be doing most of your
    practice problems. <br>


    <h2>Web development</h2>
    <p>If you know CS is for you, but your not too sure what domain you want to end up in, you should check out web
        development.</p>

    <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">FreeCodeCamp</a> is a great place to start if you don't know anything about
    HTML, CSS, or Javascript (not to be confused with Java). But it does not mean you have to start here. <br>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA">The Coding Train</a> is another
    great alternative to learning JavaScript--specifically a library called p5 used for really cool animations (A
    library is just a collection of already made functions for an easier time programming. <br> <br>

    <h2>Competitive Programming</h2>
    If you are looking to get into competitive programming <a href="http://codeforces.com/">Codeforces</a> is a great
    place to start. Contests are held weekly--if not more often. <br>
    On top of this, you should also checkout <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAeiXy8-9Y8">Errichto</a> on how
    to get into competitive programming
    (currently the number one contributor to codeforces as of 7/7/2020) and his other videos on him solving problems or
    giving tips.



    <h2>Teaching yourself</h2>
    <p>Take your education into your own hands, at your own pace.

        <br><br>
        Here are some of the best resources I have ever come across. <br>
        <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a> is a free introductory
        class offered by Harvard. Its the best introduction you will ever find to CS and if you finish this, you will
        definitly stand above your classmates. If you are serious about becoming a better programmer, this is the only
        resource you will need to become very very good. In addition, after the base course, CS50 continues into other
        domains such as <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuAxsEuxbIQ&list=PLhQjrBD2T382mHvZB-hSYWvoLzYQzT_Pb">game
            development</a>, <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T382Nz7z1AEXmioc27axa19Kv">artifical intelligence in
            python</a>, and
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T380xvFSUmToMMzERZ3qB5Ueu">web development in JavaScript
            and Python</a>
        among others.

        <br><br>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?view=1&sort=dd&shelf_id=0">The Coding Train </a>:
        Offered
        for free on youtube by a NYU professor, playlists for a very fun and
        interesting topics in CS. Personally I recommend the <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM">Nature of Code</a> playlist
        that
        ties things like physics into CS, but other highlights include <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YPSwT06y_AEYTqIwbeam3y">machine learning</a> or <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6YxDKpFzf_2D84p0cyk4T7X">working with Data and
            APIs</a>.

        <br><br>

        <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a> is fantastic for a lot of things. If you struggle with
        math or just need some brushing up, I think it is the best place to reteach yourself.

    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackerrank.com/"> HackerRank</a> is great for learning ins and outs of a
    language.<br>
    If you are having trouble with the basics, start <a
        href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=cpp"
        target="_blank">here</a> for c++. <br> <br>


    If you find yourself with some extra time here is some more stuff for you to explore:
    <ul>
        <li> This is the best resource that you will ever find for computer science: <a
                href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science">CS50</a>.<br>
            If you are serious about becoming a better programmer, this is the only resource you will need to become
            very very good. </li>
        <li> If your interested in making websites check out <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">
                FreeCodeCamp </a></li>
        <li> If you find yourself with some extra time on your hands, <a
                href="https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python?filters%5Bstatus%5D%5B%5D=unsolved&badge_type=python"
                target="_blank">python</a> is a great language. </li>
    </ul>


</p>


<p>
    <a href="https://leetcode.com/" target="_blank"> LeetCode </a> is great for interview prep and is really good for
    learning data structres. If you are going to use the <a href="https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/"
        target="_blank">"explore"</a> section for data strctures (which I recommend you should),
    make sure you do these first:
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Arrays and strings </li>
    <li> Queues and Stacks </li>
    <li> Recursion and Binary Search </li>
    <li> Linked lists </li>
    <li> Binary Trees </li>
</ol> -->


    <!-- <p> If you are interested in competitive programming, such as <a href=https://icpc.baylor.edu/ target="_blank"> ICPC
    </a>, you should express
    your interest to either Professor Waxman or Edward Cerverizzo</p> -->
